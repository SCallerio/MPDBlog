[//]: # (# About the Managed Pressure Drilling Insights Blog)
This site is built and maintained by [Santiago Callerio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santiago-callerio/), a drilling engineer and current PhD student, with over ten years of experience in Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) applications. 

After finding the need for a platform to share knowledge and insights on MPD, I created this blog to provide a space for students and professionals in the oil and gas industry to learn, discuss, and innovate in the field of drilling operations.

Besides the MPD insights, I also share Python code snippets and examples related to drilling engineering, well control, and other relevant topics. These resources are designed to help engineers and professionals enhance their skills and apply Python effectively in their work. 

Python has become an essential tool in the industry, and for my own professional development, and I aim to make it accessible to everyone interested in improving their technical capabilities.
