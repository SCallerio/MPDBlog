*New research shows that by expanding Managed Pressure Drilling from a point solution to a full-lifecycle philosophy, operators can safely extend lateral reach by 70%, cut tripping time in half, and take cementing off the critical path.*

The relentless drive for longer laterals in Argentina's Vaca Muerta field is a testament to the industry's ambition. But with laterals now pushing past 3,200 meters, operators are hitting a wall. The geomechanical complexity of the Quintuco and Vaca Muerta formations creates a narrow and unforgiving drilling window, where conventional methods struggle with equivalent circulating density (ECD) management, wellbore instability, and costly non-productive time (NPT).

A new paper, to be presented at the [*IAPG 5to Congreso Latinoamericano de Perforacion, Terminacion e Intervencion de Pozos*](https://perforacion.iapg.org.ar/), reframes this challenge. Authored by a team from The University of Texas at Austin and SLB, the work argues for a paradigm shift: viewing Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) not as a reactive tool for managing influx, but as a proactive, holistic system for optimizing the entire well construction process.

## From Drilling to "Feeling" the Way Down

The foundation of this approach is a technique called **Pressure Trapping MPD**. By drilling with a statically underbalanced mud and allowing a small, controlled influx during connections, the system provides a real-time measurement of the formation pore pressure. This transforms drilling from a pre-planned execution into a dynamic, "feel-the-way-down" process.

> "This real-time mapping effectively broadens the operational window," explains lead author Santiago Callerio. "We saw the mud weight window expand from a tight 150 g/L to a more manageable 210 g/L. This was one of the keys that unlocked the ability to drill laterals up to 70% longer without inducing losses or compromising wellbore stability."

## A Paradigm Shift in Tripping and Rollovers

Perhaps the most significant efficiency gains were realized during tripping operations. Conventionally, tripping out of a long horizontal requires a full wellbore displacement with a heavy kill mud (KM)—a time-consuming process that risks formation damage and losses.

The holistic MPD approach eliminates this. By anchoring pressure control at the maximum pore pressure depth (often much higher up the wellbore), the need for a full KM rollover is removed. The team’s analysis shows this strategy:

- **Reduces required kill mud volume by up to 67%**, saving on fluid costs and logistics.
- **Cuts net tripping time by 55%**, as stripping operations can be performed faster and more safely with real-time swab/surge monitoring.
- **Reduces circulation time for the rollover by 75%** (from 4.5 hours to just 1.1 hours), as only a small portion of the well needs to be displaced.

## Cementing with Certainty—And Off the Critical Path

The benefits extend seamlessly into the final phases. **Managed Pressure Cementing (MPC)** applies the same principles of dynamic pressure control during cement placement. This prevents the ECD spikes that plague conventional jobs, mitigating severe losses and ensuring complete zonal isolation. Field data cited in the paper shows an **83% success rate in avoiding remedial cementing**—a major NPT driver.

The ultimate optimization, however, is offline cementing. With the well secured by the wellhead, the rig can skid to the next well and begin operations while the previous well is cemented through the MPD system and waits on cement (WOC). This parallel operation removes up to 31 hours of flat time from the rig's critical path, delivering savings of approximately $150,000 per well.

By integrating these strategies, MPD evolves from a piece of hardware to an indispensable philosophy. It's a field-proven playbook for building more complex wells faster, safer, and more economically—a critical enabler for unlocking the full potential of Vaca Muerta and other high-pressure unconventional plays worldwide.
