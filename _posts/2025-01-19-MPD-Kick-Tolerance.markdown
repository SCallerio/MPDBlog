## MPD Dynamic Well Control
The use of Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) combined with mass flowmeters (i.e. Coriolis flowmeters) enhances the kick detection capability, reducing both detection time and reaction time ([Bacon et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.2118/151392-MS)). This is clearly reflected in the resulting Influx Management Envelope (IME) designs, which downsize the MPD manageable kick limit from 25 bbl. down to 15 or 10 bbl. However, the origin or basis for these reference kick volume limits is not explicitly delineated, and is often referred to as the “customary limit” or “agreed volume limit” ([Gabaldon et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.2118/194537-MS)).
MPD influx management and dynamic well control offer tangible benefits to limit gas influx volumes and facilitate influx circulation:
   - Since pressure is actively applied from surface to suppress the influx, it eliminates the after-flow effect observed in conventional well control, even in the assisted shut-in case. Thus, kick size is reduced, as shown in [Figure 1.1](#figure-downhole-influx-volume).
   - In deep-water (DW) wells, the choke line friction can be eliminated and the reduction in mud column hydrostatic is reduced when the kick is circulated rather than the low-capacity the choke line ([Bacon et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.2118/179185-MS)).

## MPD Kick Tolerance

The increasing field adoption of MPD Dynamic Well Control ([Bacon et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.2118/151392-MS); [Davoudi et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.2118/128424-PA)), pushed the growing need to update the MPD Operations Matrix ([API, 2023](https://store.accuristech.com/standards/api-rp-92m?product_id=1993607&srsltid=AfmBOoqx9RuyDzS0klhgXnTM7_Yt_rPLvs2jYys1q6N2yfpFNJ_26BJf)) operating limits to consider additional fields for MPD Dynamic Well Control. This addressed the need of identifying a priori which well influxes could be safely circulated using the MPD equipment.

>Since surface annular pressure and flow rate out increase as the influx is circulated to surface, the drilling crew needs to know a priori if that influx circulation won't exceed surface equipment limits once it reaches the surface, based on the initial pressure and volume conditions - otherwise, secondary well control needs to be engaged.

The development of an MPD Well Control Matrix, the predecessor of the Influx Management Envelope (IME), was first proposed by [Rajabi et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.2118/170684-MS), later continued by [Bacon et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.2118/173174-MS); [Hollman et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.2118/173094-MS). This requires first identifying the pressure and flow limits imposed by the surface equipment and downhole environment, as detailed in [Table 1.1 MPD Dynamic Well Control Limits](#Table-1.1:-MPD-Dynamic-Well-Control-Limits) [^1].

#### Table 1.1: MPD Dynamic Well Control Limits

| Classification                 | Parameter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Surface Equipment Pressures    | RCD Max. Static Working Pressure $$(P_{MSWP})$$<br><br>RCD Max. Dynamic Working Pressure ($$P_{MDWP}$$)<br><br>MPD PRVs Setting ($$P_{P RV}$$)<br><br>Riser Max. Working Pressure ($$P_{RMWP}$$)<br><br>Max. Stand Pipe Pressure ($$P_{SPP_{max}}$$) |
| Surface Equipment Flowrate     | MGS Liquid Handling Capacity ($$Q_{LMGS_{max}}$$)<br><br>MGS Gas Handling Capacity ($$Q_{gMGS_{max}}$$)                                                                                                                                            |
| Downhole Environment Pressures | Formation Integrity Limit ($$\rho_{LOT},\ \rho_{FIT}$$)<br><br>Max. Allowable Annular Surface Pressure ($$P_{MAASP}$$ )                                                                                                                            |

[^1]: The Riser Max. Working Pressure $$(P_{RMWP})$$ is based on marine riser max. burst pressure, and differential pressure evaluated at Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP). The Riser Max. Working Pressure ($$P_{RMWP}$$) is determined after Equations 1.1 and 1.2, where $$P_{PRV_{Riser}}$$ corresponds to the marine riser PRV setting.<br />$$P_{RMWP_1} = P_{RMWP_{lim}} − (\rho_{SMW} + \Delta{\rho_{PT_{mudline}}} − \rho_{seawater})\ Z_{mudline}\ g$$ (1.1),<br />$$P_{RMWP} = min(P_{RMWP_1}, P_{PRV_{Riser}})$$ (1.2)

The second step is to model and identify the kicks that can be safely circulated out of the well without exceeding any of the pre-defined limits [Table 1.1 MPD Dynamic Well Control Limits](#Table-1.1:-MPD-Dynamic-Well-Control-Limits) using the MPD dynamic well control procedure. Each kick is identified as a combination of kick volume (reflected as the initial pit gain in [Figure 1.2](#figure-mpd-dyn-wc) and kick intensity (reflected as the initial surface back pressure in [Figure 1.2](#figure-mpd-dyn-wc), required to suppress the kick).

(2016)](https://doi.org/10.2118/179185-MS) Standard Well Case. The upper plot shows the surface back pressure results, highlighting the Initial SBP value, when the kick is controlled, and the Max. SBP value, when the kick is at surface. The lower plot shows the Pit Volume values, highlighting the Initial Pit Gain, when the kick is controlled.</small>* |

The kick combinations that reach the limit values are then registered in an Initial Surface Back Pressure (also called Post-Influx Surface Pressure) versus Initial Influx Volume plot ([Figure 1.3](#figure-mpd-ime)):

- Combinations that exceed the surface equipment limits are registered under the “Equipment Limit” curve
- Combinations that exceed the downhole environment limits are registered under the “Weak Point Limit” curve
- The yellow area represents the influx combinations that can be safely circulated out of the well
- The red area represents the influx combinations that cannot be safely circulated out of the well, since they exceed either the equipment or weak point limit

The equipment limit curve represents the kick combinations that exceed surface equipment limits, the weak point limit curve represents the combinations that exceed downhole environment limits.</small>* |


This plot was later called the “Influx Management Envelope (IME)” ([Culen et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.2118/179191-MS); [API, 2023](https://store.accuristech.com/standards/api-rp-92m?product_id=1993607&srsltid=AfmBOoqx9RuyDzS0klhgXnTM7_Yt_rPLvs2jYys1q6N2yfpFNJ_26BJf)), used as additional guidance for MPD dynamic well control. Kick events are regularly modeled using transient multi-phase hydraulic models, however, [Culen et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.2118/179191-MS)introduced a method to analytically derive the plot using Single-Bubble formulas (i.e., the gas fraction $$\alpha_g$$ is equal to 1) and the Ideal-Gas Law. This was later refined by [Berg et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.2118/200510-MS) who coupled the Peng-Robinson ([Peng and Robinson, 1976](https://doi.org/10.1021/i160057a011)) and the Soave-Redlich-Kwong ([Soave, 1972](https://doi.org/10.1016/0009-2509(72)80096-4)) equations of state to evaluate gas conditions, still using the Single-Bubble model. Furthermore, [Patil et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.2118/189995-MS) later introduced additional considerations, as the need to satisfy the requirement to perform an MPD assisted shut-in during the kick circulation, and considering the maximum stand pipe pressures the rig can handle. The analytical derivation of an IME together with a Python tool for IME development is described in [A Python code based IME]({{ site.baseurl }}/_posts/2025-01-20-Python-IME.md).

Altogether, this methodology encompasses the framework for MPD Dynamic Influx Control during operational planning and execution, and the definition of MPD Kick Tolerance.
