This work focuses on planning and execution of Managed Pressure Tripping operations in  high-pressure extended reach (ERD) wells in Argentinaâ€™s Vaca Muerta play. Increased complexity is presented by over-pressurized naturally fractured shales in the Quintuco-Vaca Muerta system. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) with hydrostatically underbalanced muds has proven effective in managing pore pressure and mud loss risk, but tripping can be quite challenging. The paper details a new, field-proven tripping methodology.

## Anchor point and kill depth selection
- Show ESD at Shoe change with kill depth
- Show required volume and time for rollover
- Show tripping time
